# Text-generation-topsis

To apply TOPSIS for selecting the best pre-trained model for text generation based on certain criteria, you can follow these general steps. Note that you'll need to customize these steps based on your specific criteria, data, and pre-trained models.

Step 1: Define Criteria
Define the criteria that are important for selecting the best pre-trained model for text generation. These could include criteria such as perplexity, training time, model size, etc.

Step 2: Collect Data
Collect data on each pre-trained model based on the defined criteria. This might involve running the models on a validation set and collecting the necessary metrics.

Step 3: Normalize Data
Normalize the collected data to ensure that all criteria are on the same scale. For example, you might normalize perplexity scores between 0 and 1.

Step 4: Determine Weights
Assign weights to the criteria based on their importance. Weights should sum up to 1. This step involves subjective judgment and depends on your priorities.

Step 5: Calculate the Ideal and Negative-Ideal Solutions
For each criterion, identify the model with the best and worst performance. These will be your ideal and negative-ideal solutions, respectively.

Step 6: Calculate the Separation Measures
Calculate the separation measures for each model by comparing its distance to the ideal and negative-ideal solutions.

Step 7: Calculate the TOPSIS Score
Combine the separation measures into an overall TOPSIS score for each model. You can use the formula mentioned in the previous response.

Step 8: Rank the Models
Rank the models based on their TOPSIS scores. The model with the highest score is considered the best.

Step 9: Visualize and Interpret Results
Create tables and graphs to present the results. This might include a table with TOPSIS scores, a bar chart for comparison, or any other visualization that helps interpret the findings.
